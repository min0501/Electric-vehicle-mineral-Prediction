# 🚗 전기차 핵심광물의 수급안정화지수 예측 및 위기요소 탐지 모델





## 🔍 Project Description
This project develops a model to predict the stabilization index of key minerals for electric vehicles and detect crisis factors. With the growing demand for electric vehicles, the need for stable supply of key minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is increasing. This project aims to provide a **data-driven approach** to predict and manage the supply of these minerals.





## ✨ Key Features
- 📈 **Predictive Modeling**: Implements various machine learning algorithms such as Lasso, XGBRegressor, LGBMRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and SARIMAX for predictive modeling.
- 🧪 **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning of the models.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Utilizes matplotlib and statsmodels for visualizing data and model results.
- 🚨 **Crisis Detection**: Identifies potential supply crises based on model predictions.
